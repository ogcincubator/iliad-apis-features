## Ocean Information Model Records profile

Currently a stub where requirements for OIM implementation can be defined as required.

Note specific profiles will define specific requirements for interaction with external systems.

The JSON-LD Context declares the default baseURI of Observation with generic STA context and OIM specific context.

TODO: (MVP)
1 - complete OIM mapping in the context files
2 - test with more cases

Note that it may have an externally resolvable URI or be a proxy handled by ILIAD (using the OGC RAINBOW)
