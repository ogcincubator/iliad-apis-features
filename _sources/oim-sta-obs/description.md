## Ocean Information Model Observations Profile

Currently a stub where requirements for OIM implementation can be defined as required.

Note specific profiles will define specific requirements for interaction with external systems.

The JSON-LD Context declares the default baseURI of Observation with generic STA context and OIM specific context.

TODO: (MVP)
1 - implement the observableProperties Register as a concept scheme under OGC hosted
2 - define a SHACL or other rule that requires observableProperties to be registered in the ILIAD observable properties register.

Note that it may have an externally resolvable URI or be a proxy handled by ILIAD (using the OGC RAINBOW)

The mechanisms for handling external vocabulary constraints to be define here: (TBD)
