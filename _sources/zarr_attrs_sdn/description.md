## Ocean Information Model Records profile

SeadataNet format example where requirements for OIM implementation can be defined as required.

Note specific profiles will define specific requirements for interaction with external systems.

The JSON-LD Context declares the default baseURI of Observation with generic STA context and OIM specific context.

TODO: (MVP)
1 - complete OIM mapping in the context files
2 - resolve gaps with the OIM and SDN

Note that it may have an externally resolvable URI or be a proxy handled by ILIAD (using the OGC RAINBOW)
