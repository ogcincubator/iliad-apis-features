## Ocean Information Model Observations Profile for Citizen Science - Jellyfish Pilot

This specification defines the specific requirements of the ILIAD Jellyfish Pilot as an implementation of the Oceans Information Model, implemented using the SOSA Observation Feature model (compatible with OGC API Features)

Note that binding to specific packaging structures for other APIs or data formats, such as OGC APIs (STA, EDR) or NetCDF  will be done in alternative Building Blocks addressing the peculiar structural aspects of each schema.

Constraints that are not unique to the pilot should be described in one of the "parent" profiles in the chain:

- [OIM Observations for Citizen Science](../oim-obs-cs/)
- [OIM Observations](../oim-obs/)
- [OGC-API SOSA](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogcapi-sosa/)

## Key features of this profile:

- based on a generic Feature model for OGC API Features
- a schema for the hasResult element of observations
- a JSON-LD context for this result schema
- JSON-LD context elements defining namespaces for values specific to the pilot context:

e.g. 
```"observedProperty": {
      "@id": "sosa:observedProperty",
      "@type": "@id",
      "@context": {
        "@base": "https://w3id.org/iliad/jellyfish/property/"
      }
    },
```

## Future work
This profile defines Features for use in OGCAPI Features, and will be part of a suite of options bding alternative APIs to the same information model.

The SHACL rules (and any other validators developed) will be tested against the semantic annotations of each alternative to demonstrate (and help develop) these to be consistent, thus achieving **schema-agnostic semantic interoperability**.
