# Profile patterns


**Profiles** allow all the underlying details of base standards to be automatically included in testing and validation - this _encapsulates_ the underlying complexity of base specifications.
 
This dramatically **simplifies** profiles in terms of both development and usage, and ensures **consistency** and conformance of profiles with base specifications.

Typical types of profiles are a layering of general to specific, with specific benefits accruing to each layer in terms of reuse of software through to reuse of application data.

In particular, if base specifications use the OGC BuildingBlocks then profiles can _leverage_ all the effort in design, testing and validation capabilities.

Thus profiles also use the same structures, so they can be profiled in turn.

## What is a profile?

A profile defines a set of constraints on a base specification. Implementations of profiles conform to the base specification.

Because many technologies like JSON and RDF are permissive (by default) about additional information being present, definition of an *extension* is effectively defining a *constraint* on how additional information should be represented.

## Profiles of profiles... 

Profiles can be designed as separate re-usable sets of constraints that can be reused - for example a time-series of water-quality monitoring observations could be specified as a profile of both a time-series profile of Observations and a water-quality profile for the results of such observations.
In turn the time-series profile could defined as data structure using GeoJSON, or Coverage JSON.  The water-quality content requirements could be described using constraints independent of the data structure.

## What forms of constraints are possible?

The **OGC BuildingBlock** model supports a range of possible constraint approaches.  The goal is to make such constraints **_machine-readable_** to the extent possible.

Constraints SHOULD be defined in a form that allows for **_validation_** of test cases and examples.

Built-in support is provided for automatic validation of the following forms:
- project metadata (description)
- well-formed example encoding (JSON, TTL)
- JSON schema (for JSON examples) for **structure**
- SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language for RDF) for **content** and **logical consistency**

In addition [custom validators](VALIDATORS) can be added to the validation workflow. 

Using a JSON-LD context "semantic uplift" of JSON to RDF supports use of SHACL and other forms of validators to 

## Testing

Test cases should be provided for each component part of a specification.  This requires a minimal conformant **base example** that the specific test case can be added to.

(Note consideration is being given to making such a baseline example resuable by reference instead of duplication, and potentially derived automatically from declared schema)

Testing should start by validating the **base example** passes all declared constraints, then for each profile constraint:
- identifying a set of valid cases that should conform to the constraint, testing each aspect
- creating a copy of the base under the **/tests/** folder with a name indicating which constraint and case is being tested - e.g. **my-building-block/tests/mything-property-b-number.json**
- adding the specific example to the example
- creating one or more failure tests with **-fail** file name endings - e.g. **my-building-block/tests/mything-property-b-number-fail.json**
